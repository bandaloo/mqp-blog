      <h2 id="about">About</h2>

      <p>
        We are a team of three students from <a href="https://wpi.edu">Worcester
        Polytechnic Institute</a> in Worcester, Massachusetts working on an
        augmented reality project in Kyoto, Japan. We're working with 
        <a href="https://kyoto-vr.com">Kyoto VR</a> and 
        <a href="https://www.ritsumei.ac.jp/">Ritsumeikan University</a> to
        develop an AR platform for art and culture.
      </p>

      <p>
        We'll be staying in Kyoto for twelve months, from mid-July to
        mid-October to complete this project as part of our graduation
        requirements. WPI requires all students to complete a largely
        independent project called the Major Qualifying Project, or MQP, in
        senior year.
