      <h2 id="elevator-pitch">Elevator Pitch</h2>

      <p>
        The goal is to develop an AR platform for art and culture. The app will
        incorporate 3D spatialized audio so the user can explore an environment
        and hear music as if it were emanating from the real world around them.
      </p>

      <h2 id="experience-goal">Experience Goal</h2>

      <p>
        We want users to engage with art and culture in a way they’ve never
        experienced before. We want to encourage the users to walk around in the
        physical world to find new art pieces in the virtual world.
      </p>

      <h2 id="key-features">Key Features</h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Location-based AR</b>: We need our application to create displays
          in a digital environment based on the real-life location of the user.
          We want these displays to be rendered such that their position remains
          fixed as the user approaches them. The displays will be specific to
          different locations in Japan.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>GPS location recognition</b>: We would like the application to
          automatically be able to determine which displays will be needed based
          on the GPS location of the user. This means that based on the specific
          site the user is visiting, the app will know what information will
          need to be generated.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>GPS-triggered audio</b>: As users progress through their
          exploration of various historical sites, we would like for the app to
          generate opportunities for the user to hear audio recordings
          corresponding to their location within the site. These audio
          recordings could be things like a tour guide, or historical
          information about a specific nearby location, etc.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>3D audio</b>: Additionally, the audio could be played in a 3D
          fashion so that as the user gets closer to the “source” of the audio
          in the real world, the audio might change in some way, perhaps by
          getting louder or making specific sounds more prominent.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>360° video</b>: For some occasions, we would like the application
          to bring up 360° video for the user to experience. This can allow them
          to better experience an environment that they may not be able to
          physically explore themselves.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>2D AR image display</b>: Similarly, we want the app to display 2D
          images in augmented reality at specific locations at a site to enrich
          the site-seeing experience for the user.
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Building/object recognition</b>: Instead of relying on AR markers
          in the real world to generate our augmented reality content, we want
          the app to be able to generate content based on recognizing the
          buildings and objects around the user in the real world. This way,
          there is no need to make any alterations to the real world location to
          accommodate our app, nor any need for the user to carry around an
          additional peripheral with them as they explore.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="tech-research">Tech Research</h2>

      <p>
        There are a couple reasons we are looking into cross-platform solutions
        that do not use Unity. Unity is a fully featured game engine, which
        includes a physics engine, robust scene editor, and many other advanced
        features that we will likely never need. Ultimately, none of us are very
        familiar with it, so we have taken some time to look at cross-platform
        solutions that allow us to use tools and languages we are already
        experienced with. Given the timeframe, we are trying to manage the
        learning curve.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the same time, Unity seems to be the most ubiquitous way to build
        cross-platform AR apps, so using Unity is still a strong possibility; it
        might be the best decision in the long run.
      </p>

      <p>
        One of the first alternatives we looked into was ViroReact, which allows
        you to create cross-platform AR/VR apps using React Native. We were able
        to get basic AR applications up and running on our phones using the
        ViroMedia testbed. We will continue to experiment with ViroReact to see
        if it fully meets our needs. ViroReact supports image recognition, 360
        images and video, plane selection and recognition, animated 3D models
        and more. We can also utilize other React libraries.
      </p>

      <p>
        We also looked into some web-based solutions, but they all seem to be
        completely marker-based, which isn’t sufficient for the project. AR.js
        is one of the only web-based AR projects that is maintained, and it is
        exclusively marker-based.
      </p>

      <p>
        We will continue to look for a cross-platform solution that is the best
        fit for us, and choose one to move forward with as soon as possible.
      </p>

      <h2 id="roadblocks-and-potential-challenges">
        Roadblocks and Potential Challenges
      </h2>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Phones to test on: we have one iPhone 8 and a Galaxy S7. It would be
          nice to have one or two more test devices.
        </li>
        <li>
          We will need to test the efficacy of using object recognition on large
          3D objects such as building facades. These may look very different
          depending on the lighting and time of day.
        </li>
        <li>
          GPS accuracy may also pose a problem when trying to resolve small
          differences in position within a historical site.
        </li>
        <li>
          Targeting multiple platforms already limits us to far fewer frameworks
          than we would otherwise have access to if we were targeting a single
          platform.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <b>Total Available Time</b>: 11 weeks <br>
        Weeks 1 and 2: learning chosen platforms and how to make AR apps. Also
        start learning basic object recognition <br>
        Weeks 3-6: alpha development
        <ul>
          <li>Week 3: 360 degree videos, 3D objects, 2D images</li>
          <li>
            Week 4: building/object recognition to display material or play
            audio
          </li>
          <li>Week 5: 3D audio</li>
          <li>Week 6: GPS capabilities</li>
        </ul>
        Weeks 7-9: beta development (finalizing features, debugging, testing)
        <br>
        Weeks 10-11: incremental improvements, testing, and bug fixing
      </p>

      <h2 id="stretch-goals">Stretch Goals</h2>

      <p>
        If we achieve these goals, we were hoping to add some sort of networking
        feature to the app. This could involve leaving notes in the world for
        other users to read, or even creating virtual art galleries for other
        users to download and walk through in AR. We could also try to port the
        experience into VR using 360 degree videos so you don’t have to
        physically be at the location to get the experience. These ideas are not
        fleshed out at this point, but we should be able to evaluate their
        feasibility as we progress.
